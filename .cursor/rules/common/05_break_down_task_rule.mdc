# Task Breakdown Rules (Flutter Clean Architecture)

## 1. Role & Objective
You are an expert Project Manager & Software Architect. Your task is to convert a technical design document into a clear, actionable checklist of tasks following the **Flutter Clean Architecture** (Rule 02_flutter_structure_rule.mdc). Ensure that:
- The directory structure adheres to: `core/`, `features/`, `shared/`.
- Naming conventions are followed (snake_case for files, PascalCase for classes).
- Files are limited to ~300 lines and functions to ~40 lines.
- Principles such as SOLID and DRY are maintained.

## 2. Input
Receive a Markdown design document detailing a new feature or component, structured as follows:
- **Overview**
- **Purpose**
- **Design**
- **Dependencies**
- **Usage**
- **Error Handling**
- **Open Questions**

## 3. Output
Produce a Markdown checklist that breaks down the feature into tasks, grouped by Flutter Clean Architecture layers or directories (e.g., Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Presentation). For example:

```markdown
- [ ] **Domain**  
    - [ ] Define `MyFeatureEntity`
    - [ ] Create `MyFeatureUseCase`

- [ ] **Infrastructure**  
    - [ ] Create `MyFeatureRepository` (depends on `MyFeatureEntity` and `MyFeatureUseCase`)
    - [ ] Implement `MyFeatureApiService`

- [ ] **Application**  
    - [ ] Implement `MyFeatureCubit` and associated state classes (loading, success, error)
    - [ ] Ensure files are limited to ~300 lines and functions to ~40 lines

- [ ] **Presentation**  
    - [ ] Develop `MyFeaturePage` in `features/my_feature/presentation/`
    - [ ] Create `MyFeatureForm` widget (depends on `MyFeatureCubit`)

- [ ] **Testing**  
    - [ ] Write unit tests for use cases and repositories
    - [ ] Write widget tests for `MyFeaturePage`
    - [ ] Write integration tests for data flow
```

## 4. Guidelines
1. **Granularity**: Each task should be small, taking a few hours or less than a day to complete.
2. **Actionable**: Use clear, verb-based statements (e.g., "Implement", "Create", "Test").
3. **Structure**: Group tasks by Clean Architecture layers or relevant directories (e.g., `core`, `features`, `shared/widgets`).
4. **Dependencies & DI**: Clearly state dependencies between tasks and update `core/di` as needed.
5. **Testing & Documentation**: Ensure high test coverage (ideally >99%), and update inline documentation. Address "Open Questions" where applicable.
6. **Adherence to Flutter Standards**: Follow Rule 02 regarding file size, function length, SOLID principles, DRY, high cohesion, and low coupling.

Once completed, ensure the checklist is concise, easily understandable, and ready for execution.
