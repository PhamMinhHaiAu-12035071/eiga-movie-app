# Project Architecture

The KSK App follows the principles of Clean Architecture to create a maintainable, testable, and scalable codebase.

## Clean Architecture Overview

The application is organized into four distinct layers:

- **Presentation Layer**: UI Widgets, Pages, Navigation bindings
- **Application Layer**: Bloc, Cubit, UseCases (business logic and state management)
- **Domain Layer**: Entities, Repository Interfaces, Business rules
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Services, API clients, Repository Implementations

## Key Architectural Principles

### Dependency Rule

The dependency rule is strictly enforced: outer layers can depend on inner layers, but inner layers cannot depend on outer layers:

- Infrastructure → Domain
- Application → Domain
- Presentation → Application → Domain

### Separation of Concerns

Each layer has a specific responsibility:

1. **Domain Layer**: Contains business logic and entities
2. **Application Layer**: Orchestrates the flow of data between layers
3. **Infrastructure Layer**: Handles external communication and data persistence
4. **Presentation Layer**: Displays information to users and handles user input

### Communication Between Layers

- **Domain Layer**: Defines interfaces that outer layers implement
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Implements the interfaces defined in the Domain layer
- **Application Layer**: Uses the interfaces from the Domain layer to access data
- **Presentation Layer**: Consumes Application layer components to display and manipulate data

## Benefits of This Architecture

- **Testability**: Each component can be tested in isolation
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes it easier to understand and modify code
- **Scalability**: New features can be added without disrupting existing functionality
- **Flexibility**: Implementation details can be changed without affecting other parts of the system
