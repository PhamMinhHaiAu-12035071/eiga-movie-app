# KSK App

A Flutter app that allows workers to easily input order data using a modern, high-performance, and maintainable architecture.

## Project Overview

The KSK App is built with Flutter and follows Clean Architecture principles to ensure:

- Maintainable and scalable codebase
- Clear separation of concerns
- Testable components
- Proper dependency management

The application is designed to be user-friendly, performant, and robust, with a focus on providing a seamless experience for workers who need to handle order data efficiently.

## Key Features

- Order management
- Authentication and authorization
- Data synchronization
- Responsive design
- Offline capability

## Technical Highlights

- Built with Flutter
- Clean Architecture implementation
- BLoC pattern for state management
- Comprehensive testing suite
- Environment-specific configurations
- Internationalization support

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18.0 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
