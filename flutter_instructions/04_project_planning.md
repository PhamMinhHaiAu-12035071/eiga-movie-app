# Project Planning and Task Breakdown

## 1. Executive Summary
- **Objective**: Build a Flutter application following the SRS, covering essential functionalities such as Authentication and core features.
- **Scope**: From SRS analysis, design, and development to testing, including risk management and change management processes.
- **Team**: Project Manager/Lead Developer, Backend/Frontend Developers, QA, and DevOps.

## 2. Review SRS & Change Management
- **Tasks**:
  - Thoroughly review the SRS to clarify requirements.
  - Identify assumptions, constraints, and technical limitations.
  - Set up a communication channel for SRS updates and change requests.
- **Process**: Any significant changes must be updated in the backlog and timeline immediately.

## 3. Feature Breakdown Structure
- **1. Authentication**
  - 1.1 User Registration
  - 1.2 User Login
  - 1.3 Password Reset
  - 1.4 Session Management
- **2. [Feature Name]**
  - 2.1 [Sub-feature 1]
  - 2.2 [Sub-feature 2]
- *(Continue for additional modules as required)*

## 4. Development Tasks (Checklist by Layers + Testing)
### 4.1 User Registration
#### Domain Layer
- [ ] Create a `UserModel` class.
- [ ] Define the `IAuthRepository` interface with a register method.
- [ ] Define an `AuthError` enum for handling error cases.

#### Application Layer
- [ ] Create `RegisterState` and `RegisterCubit` classes.
- [ ] Implement the register method with proper email and password validation.

#### Infrastructure Layer
- [ ] Create a `UserDto` class with `fromJson`/`toJson` methods.
- [ ] Develop an `AuthApiService` for API communication.
- [ ] Implement the `AuthRepository` with a register method including network and validation error handling.

#### Presentation Layer
- [ ] Develop the `RegisterPage` and `RegisterForm` widget.
- [ ] Implement form validation and manage UI states (loading, success, error).

#### Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for `RegisterCubit` and `AuthRepository`.
- [ ] Write widget tests for the `RegisterForm`.
- [ ] Write integration tests for the registration flow.

*(Repeat a similar breakdown for User Login and other features.)*

## 5. Risk Management & Contingency Plan
- **Main Risks**: Delays in API integration, unexpected technical issues, and significant changes in requirements.
- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Prioritize critical features (P0) to ensure core functionality is delivered early.
  - Allocate an additional 10-15% time buffer per sprint.
  - Establish a quick-response checklist for handling issues as they arise.

## 6. Task Priorities
- **High Priority (Must Have)**: Authentication, Home Screen, Core Infrastructure.
- **Medium Priority (Should Have)**: Password Reset, User Profile, etc.
- **Low Priority (Nice to Have)**: Theme Customization, Advanced Filtering.

## 7. Development Timeline & Team
- **Sprint 1 (Weeks 1-2)**:
  - Complete Authentication (Registration, Login), Base Navigation setup, and CI/CD configuration.
  - Coordination between the PM and DevOps teams.
- **Sprint 2 (Weeks 3-4)**:
  - Develop Feature Set 1 and begin partial testing.
- **Sprint 3 (Weeks 5-6)**:
  - Implement Feature Set 2, optimize performance, and conduct comprehensive testing.
- **Sprint 4 (Weeks 7-8)**:
  - Finalize features, perform bug fixes, and prepare for release.

## 8. API Contracts
### Authentication API
#### Register User
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/auth/register`
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "password": "securePassword123",
    "name": "John Doe"
  }
  ```
- **Response (Success - 201)**:
  ```json
  {
    "id": "user123",
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "token": "jwt-token-here"
  }
  ```
- **Response (Error - 400)**:
  ```json
  {
    "error": "validation_error",
    "message": "Email already in use",
    "details": {
      "email": ["Email is already registered"]
    }
  }
  ```
- **Login User**: Follow a similar structure for the login endpoint.

## 9. Database Schema
### Users Collection
- **Fields**:
  - `id`: String (Primary Key)
  - `email`: String (Unique)
  - `passwordHash`: String
  - `name`: String
  - `createdAt`: Timestamp
  - `updatedAt`: Timestamp
- *(Additional collections should be defined as required by the features.)*

## 10. CI/CD & Code Standards
- **CI/CD**: Implement automated workflows for building, testing, and deployment. Tools like SonarQube can be integrated for code quality checks.
- **Code Style**: Enforce coding guidelines using linters and follow Flutter-specific code conventions.

## 11. UI Mockups & Prototype
- Provide basic wireframes outlining key screen layouts (e.g., Register, Login, Home).
- List major widgets and the logic for their display.

## 12. Documentation & Handover
- Update the README with setup instructions and a project overview.
- Document complex logic with in-code comments.
- Provide detailed guidance for the QA and operations teams.
