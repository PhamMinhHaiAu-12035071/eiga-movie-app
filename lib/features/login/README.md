# üîê Login Feature

## Overview

The login feature provides the authentication interface for users after they complete the onboarding flow. It starts with a simple welcome screen and will be expanded to include full authentication functionality in future iterations.

## Architecture

This feature follows Clean Architecture principles with a complete separation of concerns:

### Domain Layer

- Will be expanded to include authentication models and repository interfaces in future iterations

### Infrastructure Layer

- Will be expanded to include repository implementations for authentication in future iterations

### Application Layer

- **State Management**: 
  - `LoginCubit`: Manages application state for the login screen
  - `LoginState`: Contains welcome message and will be expanded for authentication

### Presentation Layer

- **Pages**: 
  - `LoginPage`: Main login screen with proper routing

- **Widgets**: 
  - `LoginView`: Displays welcome message and will contain login form

## Usage

The login screen appears automatically after users complete the onboarding flow.

## Implementation Details

### Navigation

Uses Auto Route to handle navigation from the onboarding flow.

### State Management

Uses the Cubit pattern consistent with the rest of the application:
- `LoginCubit` manages the state
- `LoginState` contains the welcome message data

### UI Design

- Implements centralized styling from core/styles
- Uses responsive design with ScreenUtil
- Follows the app's color scheme and typography guidelines

## Future Enhancements

1. Add login form with username/password fields
2. Implement authentication logic
3. Add form validation
4. Add error handling for authentication failures
5. Add "Remember me" functionality
6. Implement password reset flow

## Testing

The feature will include:
- Unit tests for the LoginCubit
- Widget tests for the LoginPage and LoginView
- Integration tests for the navigation flow
