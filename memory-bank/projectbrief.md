# KSK App Project Brief

## Project Overview
KSK App is a Flutter mobile application that allows workers to easily input order data using a modern, high-performance, and maintainable architecture. The application is designed with Clean Architecture principles and follows a feature-first approach.

## Core Requirements
1. Develop a Flutter application with a modern, maintainable architecture
2. Allow workers to easily input order data
3. Implement Clean Architecture principles with feature-first organization
4. Support multiple environments (development, staging, production)
5. Include comprehensive localization support for multiple languages
6. Ensure responsive UI across different device sizes
7. Implement thorough testing practices

## Technical Requirements
1. Use Flutter 3.5+ SDK
2. Implement BLoC pattern for state management
3. Implement dependency injection with get_it and injectable
4. Use auto_route for navigation
5. Secure environment variable handling with envied
6. Type-safe localization with slang
7. Responsive UI with flutter_screenutil
8. Network communication with dio and chopper

## Project Goals
1. Create a user-friendly interface for data input
2. Ensure high code quality and test coverage
3. Build a foundation that allows for easy feature additions
4. Provide an onboarding experience to guide new users
5. Support multiple deployment environments

## Constraints
1. Must follow established Flutter best practices
2. Must maintain backward compatibility with existing systems
3. Must handle various device sizes and orientations
4. Must be performant even with large datasets

## Timeline
The project is currently in active development with ongoing feature implementation.

## Measurable Success Criteria
1. Test coverage of at least 80%
2. Successful deployment to all target environments
3. Positive user feedback on the onboarding experience
4. Reduced error rates in order data input compared to previous systems
