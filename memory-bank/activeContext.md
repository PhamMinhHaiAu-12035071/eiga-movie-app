# Active Context

## Current Focus
The project is currently in active development, with a focus on implementing the core features and establishing the architectural foundation. The primary focus is on the onboarding feature, which is the first user interaction with the application. Currently, we are refining the UI components of the onboarding screens to match the Figma design and improve code maintainability. We're also enhancing the design system by implementing a robust color management approach for better consistency across the application.

## Recent Changes
1. Set up the project structure following Clean Architecture principles
2. Implemented the environment configuration system
3. Set up the routing system with auto_route
4. Implemented the theme management system
5. Created the onboarding feature with domain, application, infrastructure, and presentation layers
6. Refined the onboarding UI components:
   - Created a dedicated OnboardingHeader widget for better maintainability
   - Updated buttons with gradient backgrounds to match design
   - Improved color scheme for dot indicators and skip button
   - Enhanced layout with proper spacing and positioning
   - Applied UI improvements based on Figma design
7. Improved the color system:
   - Refactored AppColors to use MaterialColor for better shade variations
   - Standardized color usage across the application
   - Removed direct color references in favor of AppColors
   - Added common colors like black, white, and grey as MaterialColors

## Current Tasks
1. Complete the onboarding feature implementation
   - Finalize UI design and animations
   - Implement persistence of onboarding status
   - Add comprehensive unit and widget tests
   
2. Prepare for the next feature implementation (Order Entry)
   - Define domain models and repository interfaces
   - Design UI components and user flow
   - Plan API integration

3. Improve development infrastructure
   - Enhance CI/CD pipeline
   - Add linting rules and code quality checks
   - Set up automated testing

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Clean Architecture**: The project follows Clean Architecture principles to ensure separation of concerns and testability. This decision impacts how features are organized and how dependencies flow.

2. **State Management**: Using BLoC pattern for state management to ensure unidirectional data flow and predictable state changes.

3. **Dependency Injection**: Using get_it and injectable for dependency injection to facilitate testing and decouple components.

### Technical Considerations
1. **Performance**: Need to ensure smooth animations and transitions, especially in the onboarding feature.

2. **Offline Support**: Planning for offline capability, requiring careful design of data persistence and synchronization.

3. **Code Generation**: Heavily relying on code generation for immutable models, JSON serialization, routing, and dependency injection, which impacts the development workflow.

### Design Considerations
1. **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the UI works well on various device sizes using flutter_screenutil.

2. **Accessibility**: Need to implement proper accessibility features, including screen reader support and adequate contrast.

3. **Localization**: Implementing localization support from the beginning to avoid refactoring later.

## Next Steps
1. Complete the onboarding feature
2. Begin implementation of the order entry feature
3. Set up comprehensive testing infrastructure
4. Implement user authentication and authorization
5. Enhance the CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment

## Blockers and Challenges
1. Need to finalize API specifications for order data
2. Determining the best approach for handling offline capabilities
3. Ensuring consistent design across different platforms
4. Optimizing performance for devices with limited resources
