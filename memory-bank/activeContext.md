# Active Context

## Current Focus
The project is currently in active development, with a focus on implementing the core features and establishing the architectural foundation. The primary focus is on the onboarding feature and the newly added login feature, which represent the first user interactions with the application. Currently, we are refining the UI components of the onboarding screens to match the Figma design and improve code maintainability, while also implementing a simple login screen that appears after the onboarding flow. We're also enhancing the design system by implementing a robust color management approach for better consistency across the application.

    - Added "Impl" suffix to repository implementations (e.g., changed `FeatureRepository` to `FeatureRepositoryImpl`)
    - Updated all references throughout the codebase to reflect new naming convention
    - Regenerated dependency injection code to maintain functionality
11. Implemented abstraction for local storage:
    - Created `LocalStorageService` interface in core/services to abstract storage operations
    - Implemented `SharedPreferencesStorageService` as a concrete implementation
    - Updated `OnboardingRepositoryImpl` to depend on the abstraction instead of directly on SharedPreferences
    - Improved compliance with SOLID principles (Dependency Inversion)
    - Enhanced testability by making it easier to mock storage dependencies
12. Implemented the login feature:
    - Created login feature directory structure following Clean Architecture
    - Added LoginRoute to AppRouter for navigation from onboarding
    - Implemented LoginState using Equatable for simple state management
    - Created LoginCubit for handling login screen state
    - Developed LoginPage with proper styling and responsiveness
    - Built LoginView to display welcome message following design guidelines
    - Added detailed feature documentation in README.md
13. Created storage feature:
    - Implemented a dedicated storage feature with domain, infrastructure layers
    - Created `StorageFailure` class to represent storage operation failures
    - Implemented `LocalStorageService` interface with methods for local storage operations
    - Created `SharedPreferencesStorageService` implementation based on SharedPreferences
    - Added comprehensive unit tests with 100% coverage for the storage feature
    - Fixed lint issues in test files to follow 80-character line limit
14. Improved Makefile:
    - Simplified Makefile by removing specialized test and coverage commands
    - Updated coverage generation commands for better clarity
    - Streamlined the project command structure
15. Refactored environment configuration from core module to feature-based architecture:
    - Moved environment configuration from `core/env` to `features/env` directory
    - Reorganized according to Clean Architecture principles with domain and infrastructure layers
    - Consolidated test files to match the implementation structure
    - Fixed failing dependency injection tests
    - Ensured all tests pass with the new structure
    - Improved test organization by consolidating helper classes into appropriate test files
    - Regenerated dependency injection code to maintain functionality

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Clean Architecture**: The project follows Clean Architecture principles to ensure separation of concerns and testability. This decision impacts how features are organized and how dependencies flow.

2. **State Management**: Using BLoC pattern for state management to ensure unidirectional data flow and predictable state changes.

3. **Dependency Injection**: Using get_it and injectable for dependency injection to facilitate testing and decouple components.

4. **Feature-First Organization**: Moving core functionality like environment configuration to feature-based modules to improve cohesion and maintainability.

### Technical Considerations
1. **Performance**: Need to ensure smooth animations and transitions, especially in the onboarding feature.

2. **Offline Support**: Planning for offline capability, requiring careful design of data persistence and synchronization.

3. **Code Generation**: Heavily relying on code generation for immutable models, JSON serialization, routing, and dependency injection, which impacts the development workflow.

### Design Considerations
1. **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the UI works well on various device sizes using flutter_screenutil.

2. **Accessibility**: Need to implement proper accessibility features, including screen reader support and adequate contrast.

3. **Localization**: Implementing localization support from the beginning to avoid refactoring later.

## Next Steps
1. Complete the onboarding feature
2. Expand the login feature with full authentication
3. Begin implementation of the order entry feature
4. Set up comprehensive testing infrastructure
5. Enhance the CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment

## Blockers and Challenges
1. Need to finalize API specifications for authentication and order data
2. Determining the best approach for handling offline capabilities
3. Ensuring consistent design across different platforms
4. Optimizing performance for devices with limited resources
