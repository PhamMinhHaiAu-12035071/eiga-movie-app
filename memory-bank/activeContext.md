# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Implementing comprehensive test coverage for the Onboarding feature
- Following test-driven development practices for remaining components

## Recent Changes
- Completed OnboardingDotIndicator widget tests with 100% coverage
  - Implemented proper dependency mocking with GetIt
  - Added comprehensive edge case handling
  - Verified all style and layout properties
  - Ensured proper MaterialColor usage for theme consistency

## Next Steps
1. Implement tests for remaining Onboarding components:
   - OnboardingHeader widget
   - OnboardingNextButton widget
   - OnboardingPageView widget
   - OnboardingCubit
   - OnboardingRepository

2. Continue with Login feature implementation:
   - Design and implement authentication form
   - Add authentication logic
   - Write comprehensive tests

## Active Decisions
- Using mocktail for mocking in tests
- Following a consistent testing pattern:
  - Basic functionality
  - Edge cases
  - Style/layout verification
  - Dependency injection handling
- Maintaining strict type safety in mocks (e.g., MaterialColor vs Color)

## Current Considerations
- Need to ensure consistent test coverage across all components
- Maintaining test organization and readability
- Proper handling of GetIt dependency injection in tests
- Edge case coverage for all widget states
- Proper cleanup in tearDown to prevent test interference

## Active Work
We are currently focused on implementing a comprehensive testing strategy across all layers of the application. The main areas of focus are:

1. **Domain Layer Testing**
   - Writing unit tests for entities and value objects
   - Testing use cases and business logic
   - Implementing test coverage for domain services

2. **Widget Testing**
   - Creating widget tests for core components
   - Setting up visual regression testing
   - Implementing the robot pattern for widget test organization

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Building end-to-end tests for main user flows
   - Setting up test data factories
   - Implementing API mocking strategy

### Recent Decisions
1. Adopted mocktail for mocking in tests
2. Implemented robot pattern for widget testing
3. Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD test automation
4. Chose golden_toolkit for visual regression testing
5. Established 80% as minimum test coverage threshold

### Current Challenges
1. Handling async operations in widget tests
2. Managing test data consistency
3. Platform-specific golden test issues
4. CI/CD pipeline optimization needed
5. Test execution performance improvements required

### Active Considerations
- Balance between test coverage and maintenance overhead
- Strategies for handling flaky tests
- Approach to testing responsive layouts
- Management of test data and fixtures
- Integration of performance testing

## Technical Debt
- Some tests need refactoring for better organization
- Mock data needs better structure
- Test helper utilities need optimization
- Coverage gaps in error scenarios
- Slow test execution in CI

## Dependencies
- mocktail: ^1.0.0
- flutter_test: sdk: flutter
- integration_test: sdk: flutter
- golden_toolkit: ^1.0.0
- coverage: ^1.0.0

## Notes
- Consider implementing custom test runners for different test suites
- Need to improve error handling coverage
- Visual regression tests needed for dark/light theme variations
- Consider adding mutation testing
- Document test patterns for new contributors

## Current Challenges
1. Test Performance
   - Some widget tests are slower than desired
   - Setup/teardown optimization needed
   - Mock implementation overhead

2. Coverage Gaps
   - Integration test coverage below target
   - Some edge cases not covered
   - Complex widget interactions

3. Technical Debt
   - Linter warnings in test files
   - Inconsistent mock implementations
   - Test documentation gaps

## Notes
- Keep test files organized and well-documented
- Follow established patterns for new tests
- Maintain balance between coverage and maintainability
- Regular review of test performance metrics
