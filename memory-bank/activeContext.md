## Current Focus: Testing Implementation

### Active Work
We are currently focused on implementing a comprehensive testing strategy across all layers of the application. The main areas of focus are:

1. **Domain Layer Testing**
   - Writing unit tests for entities and value objects
   - Testing use cases and business logic
   - Implementing test coverage for domain services

2. **Widget Testing**
   - Creating widget tests for core components
   - Setting up visual regression testing
   - Implementing the robot pattern for widget test organization

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Building end-to-end tests for main user flows
   - Setting up test data factories
   - Implementing API mocking strategy

### Recent Decisions
1. Adopted mocktail for mocking in tests
2. Implemented robot pattern for widget testing
3. Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD test automation
4. Chose golden_toolkit for visual regression testing
5. Established 80% as minimum test coverage threshold

### Current Challenges
1. Handling async operations in widget tests
2. Managing test data consistency
3. Platform-specific golden test issues
4. CI/CD pipeline optimization needed
5. Test execution performance improvements required

### Next Steps
1. Complete domain layer test coverage
2. Implement remaining widget tests
3. Set up visual regression testing infrastructure
4. Create integration tests for critical paths
5. Optimize test execution and CI/CD pipeline

### Active Considerations
- Balance between test coverage and maintenance overhead
- Strategies for handling flaky tests
- Approach to testing responsive layouts
- Management of test data and fixtures
- Integration of performance testing

## Recent Changes
- Established testing architecture and patterns
- Set up mock factories and test helpers
- Configured CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
- Started implementing unit and widget tests
- Created test documentation

## Active Decisions
1. Using mocktail for mocking in tests
2. Following AAA pattern for test structure
3. Implementing golden tests for visual regression
4. Using GitHub Actions for CI/CD
5. Maintaining separate test data factories

## Current Considerations
- Test performance optimization
- Coverage targets per layer
- Visual testing strategy
- Integration test stability
- Test documentation maintenance

## Technical Debt
- Some tests need refactoring for better organization
- Mock data needs better structure
- Test helper utilities need optimization
- Coverage gaps in error scenarios
- Slow test execution in CI

## Dependencies
- mocktail: ^1.0.0
- flutter_test: sdk: flutter
- integration_test: sdk: flutter
- golden_toolkit: ^1.0.0
- coverage: ^1.0.0

## Notes
- Consider implementing custom test runners for different test suites
- Need to improve error handling coverage
- Visual regression tests needed for dark/light theme variations
- Consider adding mutation testing
- Document test patterns for new contributors

## Current Challenges
1. Test Performance
   - Some widget tests are slower than desired
   - Setup/teardown optimization needed
   - Mock implementation overhead

2. Coverage Gaps
   - Integration test coverage below target
   - Some edge cases not covered
   - Complex widget interactions

3. Technical Debt
   - Linter warnings in test files
   - Inconsistent mock implementations
   - Test documentation gaps

## Notes
- Keep test files organized and well-documented
- Follow established patterns for new tests
- Maintain balance between coverage and maintainability
- Regular review of test performance metrics
